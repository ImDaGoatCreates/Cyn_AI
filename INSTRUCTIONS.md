I wrote this program in Visual Studio Code, so I don't know if it'll work elsewhere. This program will listen to your selected microphone, transcribe the audio, and feed it to an AI model that will impersonate Cyn from Murder drones, but you need to do a few things first. 
First, you need to run Microphone_index.py to find your selected microphone's index. Then, you edit line 78 of Cyn_AI.py in your Visual Studio Code file. You edit: def recognize_speech(device_index=1)
My microphone's index number is 1, so that's what it is set to. After you run Microphone_index.py, look through the different devices. (make sure the device you're using is properly connected) Look for the index number of your selected microphone, and change the device
index in the code from 1 to whatever the index of your microphone is. And those are all the instructions for the microphone and voice recognition. Now, onto the AI part. You'll need to install a program called "LM Studio"
In LM studio, you'll need to load the AI model. I'd reccomend "lmstudio-community/Mistral-Nemo-Instruct-2407-GGUF" if your machine is strong enough. The URL in the program should automatically be correct, so don't worry about that unless you know it's different. For the 
model I use, I set the context length to 10000 tokens, the GPU offload to 30/40, and the CPU thread pool size to 3. I belive that's about it! Oh and by the way, feel free to edit the prompt for the AI however you want. Just make sure that you keep the prompt
inside the 3 single quotes to avoid any bugs.  Good luck!
